GITHUB AUTHENTICATION SETUP
==============================

Since password authentication is not supported, you need to create a Personal Access Token:

STEP 1: CREATE GITHUB PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN
--------------------------------------------
1. Go to GitHub.com and login
2. Click your profile picture (top right) → Settings
3. Scroll down to "Developer settings" (left sidebar)
4. Click "Personal access tokens" → "Tokens (classic)"
5. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
6. Give it a name like "AMIS Project Token"
7. Set expiration (recommend 90 days or No expiration)
8. Select these scopes:
   ☑ repo (Full control of private repositories)
   ☑ workflow (Update GitHub Action workflows)
9. Click "Generate token"
10. COPY THE TOKEN IMMEDIATELY (you won't see it again!)

STEP 2: USE TOKEN TO PUSH
-------------------------
After you get your token, run:

git push -u origin main

When prompted:
- Username: letsgetstartup
- Password: [paste your token here]

OR SET UP CREDENTIAL HELPER (easier for future):
git config --global credential.helper store
git push -u origin main
[enter username and token once, it will be saved]

ALTERNATIVE: USE GITHUB CLI
---------------------------
brew install gh
gh auth login
git push -u origin main

Save your token somewhere safe - you'll need it for future pushes!
